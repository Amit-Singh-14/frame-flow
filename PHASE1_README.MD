### Phase 1 Development Order:

1. **Setup project structure** (Day 1)
2. **Database setup** with basic tables (Day 1-2)
3. **Go service** - basic file processing (Day 2-4)
4. **Node.js API** - upload endpoints (Day 4-6)
5. **React frontend** - basic UI (Day 6-8)
6. **Docker setup** (Day 11-12)

This structure scales perfectly from Phase 1 through Phase 5. Each service is independent, well-organized, and easy to extend. The separation of concerns makes it easy to work on different parts simultaneously and deploy them independently.
